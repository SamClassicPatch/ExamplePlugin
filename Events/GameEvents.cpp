{
  // This function is executed after starting the simulation for the first time after loading
  // a level but before adding any of the players (even local server ones). It can be used to
  // safely modify the level as if it was already played on a little bit and even vanilla clients
  // will see the changes after connecting to the server (e.g. item replacements).

  // This only works on the very first level started by the game/server and won't work after
  // changing levels. For that, you have to either use IGameEvents::OnChangeLevel() or replace
  // both of these functions with code inside IWorldEvents::OnWorldLoad(). But NEITHER of these
  // methods will work for clients that don't have this plugin downloaded and installed locally,
  // unless you decide to send built-in extension packets (commands prefixed with "pck_").

  // EXAMPLE: Find all beheads and replace them with kamikazes
  CEntities cenHeadmen;
  IWorld::FindClassesByID(IWorld::GetWorld()->wo_cenEntities, cenHeadmen, 303); // CHeadman_ClassID
